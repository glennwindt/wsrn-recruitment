  <!-- Founder Introduction -->
  <section>
    <h2>Founder & Visionary</h2>
    <p>
      Although I was born in Curaçao, in the Dutch Caribbean, and have spent most of my life in the Netherlands, I am now proud to reside in Portugal, where I have lived for the past three years. My journey has been driven by a strong desire to contribute positively to Portugal’s economy and social development.

    <h2>Motivation & Values</h2>
    <p>
      Guided by a spiritual perspective that emphasizes integrity, service, and positive engagement, I believe that success is rooted in purpose and ethical action.

  <!-- Company Mission -->
  <section>
    <h2>Company Mission</h2>
    <p>
      My goal with WSRN is to establish an innovative, responsible, and sustainable platform that strengthens Portugal’s role in the global maritime industry. With a firm belief in the transformative potential of technology and AI, my vision is to streamline recruitment, legal procedures, and payroll management for seafarers and shipping companies worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dedication, grounded in my spiritual values, fuels my unwavering commitment to uphold Portuguese laws, contribute to the local economy, and help Portugal become a leader in maritime staffing and innovation.
    </p>

  <!-- Legal Compliance -->
  <section>
    <h2>Compliance & Integration</h2>
    <p>
      WSRN is being built with full compliance to Portuguese law and international social security regulations for seafarers. It will provide a structured, secure, and transparent environment for seafarers, agencies, and shipping companies alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Portugal has offered me the opportunity to rebuild and reshape my vision for a better maritime staffing network. I aim to support foreign seafarers who wish to work under Portuguese law, offering them access to visa processing, NIF registration, and SEF application tracking through WSRN’s automated system.
