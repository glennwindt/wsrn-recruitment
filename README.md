# Worldwide Seafarers Recruitment Network (WSRN)

A platform for managing recruitment, legal compliance, and payroll for seafarers and shipping companies.

## Mission

My goal with WSRN is to establish an innovative, responsible, and sustainable platform that strengthens Portugal’s role in the global maritime industry. With a firm belief in the transformative potential of technology and AI, my vision is to streamline recruitment, legal procedures, and payroll management for seafarers and shipping companies worldwide.

I reside in Portugal and have lived here for the past three years. My spirituality provides the foundation for my commitment to building a trustworthy, impactful, and sustainable business.
